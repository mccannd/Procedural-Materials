# Procedural Materials

![](./Preview.png)

This is a collection of procedural textures made in Substance Designer and rendered in Marmoset Toolbag, with a roughness-metallic Cook-Torrance shader model.

These substance graphs have been cleaned up and organized into logical blocks for anyone to read and incorporate techniques into their own work.

I will probably revisit this repo with more materials since they're super fun to make.
